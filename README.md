# LiteDemonSlayerPacMan

More playable version of my javaFx Pac-Man game.

Keep in mind:
Arrow keys are needed.
There is a bug in safari where the slayer gifs are stuck in certain indexes of the grid.


How To Play
1) Press on Launch
2) Select the character you want to play against
3) You have three lives. If the slayer shares the same index as you, you are relocated to your spawning index.
4) To win, collect all the dots
5) To play again, refresh the page

Note: The gameplay isn't identical to the javafx implementation of this game.
